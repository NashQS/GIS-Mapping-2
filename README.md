# GIS-Mapping
Desiging and creating a map using Quantum GIS -Chimanimani District

### Project Overview
---
Objective: To create a comprehensive geospatial map of Chimanimani District using Quantum GIS (QGIS) for improved land management, infrastructure planning, and environmental monitoring.

### Key Steps 

    Data Collection:
        Gather geospatial data from satellite imagery, existing maps, and field surveys.
        Include land use, topography, hydrology, transportation networks, and key infrastructure such as schools, clinics, and administrative boundaries.

    Data Processing:
        Use QGIS to clean, organize, and layer the data.
        Integrate multiple layers including vector and raster data for a detailed spatial analysis.

    Spatial Analysis:
        Perform analysis on various aspects such as land use patterns, population distribution, and environmental zones.
        Identify critical areas such as flood-prone zones, agricultural lands, and urban growth boundaries.

    Map Production:
        Create thematic maps focusing on specific land use such as soil type,infrastructure development, resource allocation, and environmental conservation.

### Source
    Shp Files and Data taken from various websites and they are loaded in the folde.

### Tools
    Quantum GIS
    
### Mapping

    1. Install QGIS: Download and install QGIS, then set up the toolbars and necessary plugins.
    2. Collect Data: Gather spatial data (e.g., shapefiles, GPS data) and attribute data (e.g., population, land use).
    3. Load Data: Import vector and raster data into QGIS as separate layers (roads, land use, buildings).
    4. Style Layers: Customize each layer's symbology (colors, lines, symbols) and apply categorized or graduated styling to represent data effectively.
    5. Edit Data: Clean and update data, fixing errors using editing tools (split, merge features) and correcting geometry errors (overlaps, gaps).
    6. Spatial Analysis (Optional): Conduct analysis such as buffering, intersecting layers, or raster operations.
    7. Georeferencing: Align scanned maps or images to real-world coordinates using the georeferencer tool.
    8. Add Labels: Label key features like roads or towns by setting up label rules based on attribute data.
    9. Scale and Legends: In the map layout, add a scale bar to show distances, and insert a legend to explain map symbols.
    10. Final Map Layout: Design the map layout by including a title, north arrow, and grid lines if necessary. Arrange elements for clear presentation.
    11. Export Map: Export the final map as PDF, PNG, or share it online using QGIS plugins.
